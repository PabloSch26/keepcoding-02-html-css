# CSS and HTML Project Submission

This project was created with the purpose of practicing and demonstrating the knowledge acquired in virtual classes about HTML and CSS.

## The project covers the following key aspects:

- Implementation of structured **HTML** and its interaction with the **DOM**, accompanied by cascading styles using **CSS**.
- Proper use of **semantic** HTML tags, combined with CSS rules that enhance accessibility and performance.
- Development of **media queries** to ensure a **responsive** design adaptable to various screen resolutions.
- Creation of dynamic **animations** and **transitions** using **CSS** to enhance user experience.
- Customization of animations through the use of **keyframes**, achieving unique visual effects.
- Design of a **responsive layout** using **CSS grids** for a flexible and scalable structure.
- Application of correct **CSS hierarchy**, ensuring proper styling and visual consistency of elements.
- Analysis of the behavior of different **HTML tags** and their interaction with **CSS** to optimize content presentation.
- Implementation of **input fields** with effective **validations**, ensuring proper user interaction with forms.
- Inclusion of **links** for navigation to other websites, improving connectivity and accessibility.
- Guarantee of **code cohesion and cleanliness**, with an organized structure that facilitates project maintenance and scalability.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a personal **portfolio** (or one for a fictional character), applying the knowledge acquired in class. The idea is to create an interactive and visually attractive presentation that showcases the skills and projects of our chosen character, using the technologies and practices learned during the course.

## Project Details

- A **header** must be created, where links should have a smooth `hover` transition effect. These links are not necessary on the mobile version.
- A section with an **about us** description and our skills represented through **progress bars**. These bars must be animated using **CSS**.
- A **banner** that must have a background image. On mobile screens, a different image should be displayed (implement **media queries** or **responsive images**).
- A contact form using **input fields**. All fields must use the correct types and proper HTML validation:
  - **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Phone Number** (required fields).
  - **Radio input** to answer the question "How did you hear about me?" (required field):
    - University
    - Keepcoding kick-off
    - School
    - On GitHub
  - **GitHub tag** (Use regex `^@[^\s]+` for validation - `@username`).
  - **Textarea** for more user information (max 180 characters) (required field).
  - **Checkbox** for **newsletter** subscription.
  - **Save** and **reset** buttons.
- **Footer** with links to our social media using external resources.
- A new page containing a **video** that plays automatically when the user enters the website, with a **fadeIn** animation.
- Create another page with a **grid** displaying our projects.

## Technologies

This project was developed exclusively using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For content structuring and creating the webpage layout.
- **CSS**: For the visual design and styling of the page, ensuring an attractive and consistent user experience.
